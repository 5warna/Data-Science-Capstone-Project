# Description
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderaterespiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. However,some will become seriously ill and require medical attention. Older peopleand those with underlying medical conditions like cardiovascular disease,diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer are more likely to developserious illness. Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill ordie at any age.
Machine learning algorithms and models can be used to predict importantfuture Covid case data such as infection rates (outbreaks) and mortality rates.The predicted case data can be used to help control Covid, aid in bettertreatments and vaccines, or even lead to a cure.

# Objective
The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable(Classification Final). Predictor variables includes age, sex, patient type, different pregnancy-related situations, patients with various conditions, and more. I created and trained a number of Machine Learning models using various classification algorithms for prediction of Corona Virus in patients. This is Multiclass Classification Dataset with outcome column(1-7).

I created a visualization using Python and dashboard for visualization in Tableau also.
