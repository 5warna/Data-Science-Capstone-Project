## Description

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. However, some will become seriously ill and require medical attention. Older people and those with underlying medical conditions like cardiovascular disease,diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die at any age.
Machine learning algorithms and models can be used to predict important future Covid case data such as infection rates (outbreaks) and mortality rates. The predicted case data can be used to help control Covid, aid in better treatments and vaccines, or even lead to a cure.

## Objective

The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable(Classification Final). Predictor variables includes age, sex, patient type, different pregnancy-related situations, patients with various conditions, and more. I created and trained a number of Machine Learning models using various classification algorithms for prediction of Corona Virus in patients. This is Multiclass Classification Dataset of outcome column(1-7). 

I created visualization using Python and dashboard for visualization in Tableau also.

## Data Visualization

Before building the machine learning models, explored the dataset using data visualization techniques. Plotted Count plots, Violin plots, Pair plots, and Correlation matrices to gain insights into the distribution of our features and their relationships with each other. These visualizations helped us identify potential insights and understand the underlying relationships between the features.

## Machine Learning Models

### Decision Tree Classifier
### K-Nearest Neighbor
### Random Forest Classifier
### Adaboost Classifier

Applied the above classifier models to the dataset and also used grid search cross-validation technique to tune the hyperparameters of the models. Plotted a confusion matrix to understand the true positive and false positive rates of the multiclass classification model.

## Conclusion

In conclusion the results of this project can be used by healthcare professionals to develop preventative measures for patients who get Corona Virus can avoid higher risk of developing respiratory problems. Overall, this project demonstrates the potential of machine learning models in improving healthcare outcomes.
